#### Calculating the relative frequencies #### <- evtl. l?schen, da beinahe keine Werte mehrmals. Evtl mit Intervallen arbeiten? Kommentar Franca: Ja, bei continous variable oder vielen values macht es keinen Sinn, Intervalle sinnvoller 
# table(VARIABLE) Examination und Education einzige Variablen mit gleichen Variablen 
# M?ssten wir nicht die Variablen durch die Anzahl der Beobachtungen teilen? 
# length(mydata)=6. D.h. wir m?ssten wenn dann z.B. Fertility/length(mydata$fertility) berechnen? 
# Kommentar Elias: Habe die Rel. angepasst.

## Creating frequency brackets for analysis ##

lower_bound <- 60  ## defining the lower bound as 60 ##
upper_bound <- 90  ## defining the upper bound as 90 ##
Fertility_low <- c(Fertility <= lower_bound)  ## defining low fertility as values below the lower bound ##
Fertility_average <- between(Fertility, lower_bound, upper_bound)  ## defining average fertility as values between the lower and the upper bound ##
Fertility_high <- c(Fertility >= upper_bound)  ## defining high fertility as values above the upper bound ##

Rel.Freq_Fertility_low <- sum(Fertility_low) / length(Fertility)  ## calculating the relative frequency of low fertility ##
Rel.Freq_Fertility_average <- sum(Fertility_average) / length(Fertility)  ## calculating the relative frequency of average fertility ##

#### Histogram: Distribution ####
hist(Fertility, main = "Fertility", xlab = "Fertility") # Fertility rates are mostly between 60 and 90% 


#### Density Plot of response variable #### 
plot(density(Fertility), main = "Fertility")
abline(v=c(68, 70.14, 70.4), col="gray94") # a little bit right skewed, mode is defined visually, check visually with hist if more data is on the right side 
#<> Isn't it skewed to the left? Kommentar Franca: right skewed: most of the data is on the right side of the mode, mean and median are > mode 
# Merker Elias: Discuss skewnwess again


#### Inspecting and plotting the covariance and correlation #### 
cov(mydata)
cor(mydata) # correlations with response variable lower than .8. 

## Plotting the correlation matrix ##
require(lattice)
levelplot(cor(mydata), xlab = "", ylab = "")

## General plot of all variables ##
pairs(mydata, upper.panel = NULL, pch=20,cex=1.25) # assumption: linear relationship between education and examination/examination and agriculture 
# Kommentar Elias: Adjusted the matrix for more clarity

## Perform a stepwise regression

# Forward Regression
step(lm_swiss1, direction = "forward",  scope = list(lower = lm_swiss1, upper = lm_swiss2))

# Graphical Representation

# Visualizing BIC and AdjR2
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(model_eva) #the lower the bic the better the model best model includes agriculture, education, catholic and infant mortality

### Diagnostics ###
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(Reg_full) 
# Plot 1: Residual plot, no pattern observed constant variance assumption holds 
# Plot 2: Normal Q-Q plot, normality assumption holds 
# Plot 3: some influential points 

## Identifying influential points
