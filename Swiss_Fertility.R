#### Re-naming the relevant variables for easier access ####
attach(mydata) # Kommentar Franca: attach(mydata) wir kÃ¶nnten auch nur diesen Code verwenden  anstatt sechs variablen machen

#### Descriptive Statistics ####
################################

#### Getting a general overview of the data #### 
summary(mydata) # Franca Kommentar: Catholic: Median and Mean are completely different, also high sd (41)


#### Drawing a boxplot for first inspection ####
# We have to watch out with "Catholic" as it is more or less a "binary" variable
boxplot(mydata)


#### Calculating the relative frequencies #### <- evtl. l?schen, da beinahe keine Werte mehrmals. Evtl mit Intervallen arbeiten? Kommentar Franca: Ja, bei continous variable oder vielen values macht es keinen Sinn, Intervalle sinnvoller 
# table(VARIABLE) Examination und Education einzige Variablen mit gleichen Variablen 
# M?ssten wir nicht die Variablen durch die Anzahl der Beobachtungen teilen? 
# length(mydata)=6. D.h. wir m?ssten wenn dann z.B. Fertility/length(mydata$fertility) berechnen? 

Rel.Freq_Fertility = Fertility / length(mydata$Fertility)
Rel.Freq_Agriculture = Agriculture / length(mydata)
Rel.Freq_Examination = Examination / length(mydata)
Rel.Freq_Education = Education / length(mydata)
Rel.Freq_Catholic = Catholic / length(mydata)
Rel.Freq_InfantMortality = InfantMortality / length(mydata)

### Empirical Distribution Function Plots ###
plot.ecdf(Fertility, main = "Empirical Distribution Function Fertility")
plot.ecdf(Agriculture, main="Empirical Distribution Function Agriculture")
plot.ecdf(Examination, main = "Empirical Distribution Function Examination")
plot.ecdf(Catholic, main = "Empirical Distribution Function Catholic") # looks like binary 
plot.ecdf(Infant.Mortality, main = "Empirical Distribution Function Infant Mortality")


## Creating frequency brackets for analysis ##
# Warum diese Ober- und Untergrenze?
lower_bound <- 60  ## defining the lower bound as 60 ##
upper_bound <- 90  ## defining the upper bound as 90 ##
Fertility_low <- c(Fertility <= lower_bound)  ## defining low fertility as values below the lower bound ##
Fertility_average <- between(Fertility, lower_bound, upper_bound)  ## defining average fertility as values between the lower and the upper bound ##
Fertility_high <- c(Fertility >= upper_bound)  ## defining high fertility as values above the upper bound ##

Rel.Freq_Fertility_low <- sum(Fertility_low) / length(Fertility)  ## calculating the relative frequency of low fertility ##
Rel.Freq_Fertility_average <- sum(Fertility_average) / length(Fertility)  ## calculating the relative frequency of average fertility ##
Rel.Freq_Fertility_high <- sum(Fertility_high) / length(Fertility)  ## calculating the relative frequency of high fertility ##

print(Rel.Freq_Fertility_low)
print(Rel.Freq_Fertility_average)
print(Rel.Freq_Fertility_high)


#### Histogram: Distribution ####
hist(Fertility, main = "Fertility", xlab = "Fertility") # Fertility rates are mostly between 60 and 90% 


#### Density Plot of response variable #### 
plot(density(Fertility), main = "Fertility")
abline(v=c(68, 70.14, 70.4), col="whitesmoke") # a little bit right skewed, mode is defined visually, check visually with hist if more data is on the right side 
#<> Isn't it skewed to the left? Kommentar Franca: right skewed: most of the data is on the right side of the mode, mean and median are > mode 


#### Inspecting and plotting the covariance and correlation #### 
cov(mydata)
cor(mydata) # correlations with response variable lower than .8. 

## Plotting the correlation matrix ##
require(lattice)
levelplot(cor(mydata), xlab = "", ylab = "")

## General plot of all variables ##
pairs(mydata) # assumption: linear relationship between education and examination/examination and agriculture

###### Exploring the Data ######

#### Ranking of provinces with regards to fertility rates ####
## Top 10 provinces with high fertility ##

### Full Model ###

Reg_full <- lm(Fertility ~  Agriculture + Education + Examination + Catholic + Infant.Mortality, data = mydata)
summary(Reg_full) # Examination not significant 

# Why exclude examination? (=> potential OVB )
Reg_fullwoexam <- lm(Fertility ~  Agriculture + Education + Catholic + Infant.Mortality, data = mydata)
summary(Reg_fullwoexam)


### Diagnostics ###
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(Reg_full) 
# Plot 1: Residual plot, no pattern observed constant variance assumption holds 
# Plot 2: Normal Q-Q plot, normality assumption holds 
# Plot 3: some influential points 

## Identifying influential points 
mydata[cooks.distance(Reg_full) > 0.1,] # Sierre, Rive Gauche, Porrentruy, Neuchatel, Rive Droite, Rive Gauche
